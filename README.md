![ER-Diagram](imgs/1.%20ER%20Diagram.png)
Using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)

# Phase TWO
in this phase, simple SQL queries are executed
- Queries to create tables
- Insertion queries and checking data types to be valid
- Insert, modify and delete data
- `Name` and `Age` of all the `Authors` that authored a `Book`
